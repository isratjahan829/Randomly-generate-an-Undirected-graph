# Randomly-generate-an-Undirected-graph

Randomly-generate an undirected graph represented by adjacency matrix with n = 1000 vertices.Determine number of edges in the graph. Determine degrees of all vertices. Show that Handshaking logic holds. Determine computational time in this step (except printing time) in ms. Determine an approximate time complexity of your program as a function of n.
